# Healthcare Operations & Patient Insights Analysis  
### Business Analyst • Healthcare Domain • Python • Documentation

---

# 📌 1. Problem Statement  
Hospitals face operational challenges such as long patient stay durations, inconsistent billing, uneven room utilisation, and missing clinical documentation (doctor details, test results).  
These gaps reduce efficiency, increase cost, and impact patient care quality.

The goal of this project is to analyse hospital operational data using **Python** and generate actionable insights while creating **Business Analyst documentation** aligned with real industry practices.

---

# 📌 2. Project Overview  
This project delivers a complete analysis of hospital operations, covering:

- Length of Stay (LOS)  
- Billing patterns  
- Admission type distribution (Urgent vs Non-Urgent)  
- Room utilisation metrics  
- Medical condition frequency  
- Documentation gaps  

The project outputs both **technical insights** (KPI dashboards, Python analysis) and **BA deliverables** (BRD, SRS, User Stories, CRF, UAT, Workflow).

---

# 📌 3. Dataset Description  
The dataset includes key hospital and patient attributes:

- **Demographics:** Name, Age, Gender, Blood Type  
- **Clinical:** Medical Condition, Medication, Test Results  
- **Operational:** Admission Date, Discharge Date, Hospital, Doctor, Room Number  
- **Financial:** Billing Amount  
- **Admission Metadata:** Urgent / Non-Urgent  

Python is used to clean, analyse, visualize, and derive KPIs from the dataset.

---

# 📌 4. Project Objectives  
- Analyse operational efficiency using LOS, billing, and utilisation metrics.  
- Identify high-cost conditions, long-stay cases, and documentation issues.  
- Generate KPIs and visual insights for decision-making.  
- Produce Business Analyst documentation aligned with healthcare domain workflows.  
- Improve understanding of clinical operations to support BA responsibilities (requirement gathering, reporting, documentation).

---

# 📌 5. Tools & Technologies  
**Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
**IDE:** Jupyter Notebook  
**Documentation:** BRD, SRS, User Stories, CRF, UAT, Workflow  
**Version Control:** GitHub

# 📌 7. Data Cleaning (Python)  
✔ Handled missing values (Doctor, Test Results, Billing)  
✔ Standardised categories (Gender, Admission Type, Conditions)  
✔ Converted admission/discharge dates  
✔ Created **Length of Stay (LOS)**  
✔ Flagged incomplete records  

---

# 📌 8. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)  

### **Demographics**
- Age distribution  
- Gender split  
- Condition frequency  

### **Operational Metrics**
- LOS distribution  
- LOS by admission type  
- Room utilisation patterns  

### **Financial Insights**
- Billing distribution  
- Billing by condition  
- Billing outliers  

---

# 📌 9. KPIs Generated  
| KPI | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Average Billing Amount** | Overall cost indicator |
| **Median Billing** | Typical patient billing |
| **Average LOS** | Hospital stay efficiency |
| **LOS by Admission Type** | Urgent vs Non-Urgent comparison |
| **Urgent Admission %** | Patient severity distribution |
| **Room Utilisation %** | Resource usage efficiency |

---

# 📌 10. Key Insights  
### 🔹 Operational  
- Urgent patients show **higher LOS**, indicating workflow bottlenecks or higher severity.  
- A few rooms account for **majority of admissions**, indicating resource imbalance.  

### 🔹 Financial  
- Billing varies significantly across conditions → high-cost conditions identified.  

### 🔹 Documentation  
- Missing doctor names and test results → documentation gaps affecting compliance.  

---

# 📌 11. Business Analyst Deliverables  

### **📘 BRD – Business Requirements Document**
- Objective, scope, KPIs, stakeholders, risks, success criteria  

### **📘 SRS – Software Requirements Specification**
- Functional & non-functional requirements  
- LOS, Billing, Admission, Filters, KPI modules  

### **📘 User Stories (Agile Format)**
- LOS monitoring  
- Billing comparison  
- Room utilisation  
- Documentation quality  

### **📘 CRF – Case Report Form**
- Standard data collection fields for patients  

### **📘 UAT Test Cases**
- LOS validation  
- KPI verification  
- Admission filter checks  
- Smoke tests  

### **📘 Defect Log**
- Identified negative LOS issue  
- Documentation gaps  

### **📘 Workflow Diagram**
- End-to-end hospital operations lifecycle

# 📌 12. Conclusion  
This project demonstrates strong analytical, documentation, and business understanding skills required for a **Business Analyst in the healthcare domain**.  
Using Python, we generated KPIs and insights that help improve:

- Hospital operational efficiency  
- Resource utilisation  
- Documentation accuracy  
- Billing transparency  
- Decision-making  

The combined technical analysis + BA documentation closely aligns with real industry expectations, especially for roles like **Associate Business Analyst at RioMed**.
